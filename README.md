# REsource Advertisement and Reservation Protocol (REAR)

The REAR (REsource Advertisement and Reservation Protocol) protocol aims at providing secure data exchange of resources and capabilities between different cloud providers.
It can be used to advertise resources (e.g., virtual machines and their characteristics in terms of CPU, RAM), capabilities (e.g., Kubernetes clusters) and (in future) services (e.g., a database as a server) to any third party, enabling potential customers to know what is available in other clusters, and possibly (automatically) establish the technical steps that enables the customer to connect and consume the resources/services agreed in the negotiation phase.
